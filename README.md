Title: For and while loop

Loop-Based C++ Programs: Theory, Algorithms, Output & Explanation
This repository contains detailed explanations of loop concepts in C++, followed by examples of programs based on for and while loop and also includes programs related pattern printing which includes the concept of loops only.

Loops in C++
Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a condition is met. They are essential for tasks such as iterating over arrays, automating repetitive logic, or building interactive programs.

Types of Loops
1. For Loop
Used when the number of iterations is known beforehand.
Combines initialization, condition checking, and increment/decrement in a single line.
for(initialization; condition; increment) {
    // body of loop
}
2. While Loop
Used when the number of iterations is not known.
The condition is checked before the loop body is executed.
while(condition) {
    // body of loop
}
3. Do-While Loop
Ensures that the loop body executes at least once.
The condition is checked after the loop body.
do {
    // body of loop
} while(condition);
Program Analysis
1. Print 'SIT' 5 times
Theory: Demonstrates a simple for loop which print "SIT" 5 times each in new line.

Algorithm:

Initialize a counter from 0.
Run the loop till counter < 5.
Print "SIT" in each iteration.
Output:

SIT
SIT
SIT
SIT
SIT
2. Print Even numbers from 0 to 10
Theory: Uses conditional logic and controlled incrementing inside the loop and printseven numbers from 0 to 10.

Algorithm:

Start a counter from 0.
Run loop until counter <= 10.
Print counter if even.
Increment by 2 each iteration.
Output:

0
2
4
6
8
10
3. Validating password from user by while loop.(a working login page)
Theory: This program demonstrates user input validation and multiple loop exits by taking input from user validating via "if condition" .

Algorithm:

Take PRN and password input.

Loop to check password match.

If wrong, display menu:

Retry
Change Password
Forgot Password
Exit
Proceed based on user's choice.

Output:

Welcome to MOODLE software.
Enter your PRN (numbers only): 24070123069
Set your password (numbers only): 12345678
Enter your password to login: 2345678
Incorrect password!
--- MENU ---
1. Retry login
2. Change password (requires old password)
3. Forgot password
4. Exit
Enter your choice: 1
Enter your password to login: 12345678
Login successful! Welcome to your portal.
4.Print Digits in reverse order of a number
Theory: Uses for loop with modulus and division to reverse digits and print them in new line each based on number.

Algorithm:

Input a number.

While number > 0:

Get last digit using %10.
Print digit.
Divide number by 10.
Output:

Enter num:
23069
9
6
0
3
2
5. Nested for Loop
Theory: Demonstrates nested loop control which shows how outer loop runs first for first iteration then moves to inner loop and moves back to outer one.

Algorithm:

Outer loop runs 2 times.
Inner loop runs 3 times per outer loop iteration.
Print values of outer and inner loop counters.
Output:

Outer:1
Inner:1
Inner:2
Inner:3
Outer:2
Inner:1
Inner:2
Inner:3
6.Printing Left Aligned Star pattern
Theory: Builds a basic triangle shape using stars and prints them left aligned .

Algorithm:

Outer loop for rows from 1 to 5.
Inner loop prints * equal to current row number.
Output:

*
**
***
****
*****
7. Printing Right Aligned Star pattern
Theory: Combines spacing and star printing for alignment and aligns pattern right side.

Algorithm:

Outer loop for rows.
First inner loop prints spaces.
Second inner loop prints stars.
Output:

    *
   **
  ***
 ****
*****
8. Floyds Series
Theory: This program prints numbers in ascending order as per the series each in new line using nested for loop.

Algorithm:

Use nested loops.
Keep a counter starting from 1.
For each row, print increasing numbers.
Output:

1
2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9 10
9. HourglassPattern.cpp
Theory: This program prints a symmetric hourglass pattern with the help of teo for loops each used to print the upward and downward triangle respectively.

Algorithm:

First loop for decreasing rows:

Print spaces then stars.
Second loop for increasing rows:

Print spaces then stars.
Output:

* * * * *
 * * * *
  * * *
   * *
    *
   * *
  * * *
 * * * *
* * * * *
Conclusion
Loops form the backbone of repetitive logic in C++ and are used in everything from simple pattern generation to real-world applications like authentication systems. Understanding their behavior, syntax, and flow helps in writing efficient and structured programs. This collection of loop programs demonstrates a range of use cases to help strengthen conceptual clarity and hands-on coding skills.
